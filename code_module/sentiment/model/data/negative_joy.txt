I have a toothache. I don't have much energy or motivation.
Eh I'm ok. Wanted someone to come over tonight but they can't
I'm just thinking about my friends
Not good. My parents have moved hundreds of miles away. I'm all alone now
Hey been feeling pretty good. The last week has been good aside from one fight with my dad that was kinda big but it's whatever.
Frustrating. I had to deal with someone's bs excuses.
I'm in pain and I'm super tired
I'm feeling a little bit upset and that I'm a burden and that no one wants me.
Hey! I'm alright! I'm in Guelph so I'm feeling pretty sentimental but in an alright way. Heading back with izzy to Toronto now.
Oh alright.  Just relaxing pretty much
I am doing better. I was sick this afternoon. I gave God my purple pen. Now I'm good and feeling much happier.
I'm fine I guess. I went to the ER to have tests done. That wasn't much fun.

Today was a nice relaxing day. Went grocery shopping at walmart and it was packed. My anxiety was crazy there but I'm ok.
Spent entire day feeling dizzy and fuzzy-headed and needing to sleep to make that feeling go away. Very unproductive day.
Good! Had my therapy session a little later today and it went well. Not sure if I need this thing anymore
I am feeling pretty good today.  At first I was really angry and having a hard time with everything.  I felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders.  Then I tried hard to have fun.  I cried along the way quite a few times but then I did it.
Hi friend. Today was a good Monday! I wish I would have worked out though.

I'm feeling okay. Today is a half day so I've finished school and me and mama are gonna go shopping to see if I find anything for my birthday and I think my friends are doing a group present for my birthday and Sarah and Olivia are in on it so I feel kinda bad that I'm not doing one for Sarahs but I'm gonna do like a SARAHS RANDOM JUNK box that has photos and memories and a playlist and so on which I hope she likes and I wanted it to be a kind of 'last present' because as you know we are drifting apart and it's more of a remember me type thing and remember all the memories we shared rather then a I love you so so much and we are going to be friends forever. So I'm gonna buy that stuff now too and then I'm gonna study because I can't remember anything about science or math and I need to study for mÄori and ugh
Thinking about the future. I still have hope because I will see Nolin on Monday in the library.

I'm feeling good. I spent the day on two APC training courses and they were excellent courses about preparing for the case study and final assessment.\n\nI'm thinking I might apply for CIOB just to get people off my back and then sit the RICS one in May. But also thinking I need to get all paper work complete by end of this month. Planning on studying tonight.  I have just been cooking - my first Abel \u0026 Cole meal which was delicious. Definitely going to continue with this. All I need to do is clean my flat. Firstly exercise and study tonight.  That's a lot considering it's now 20:31.
Currently sitting at Philz on 24th. Start work tomorrow and am feeling a bit nervous but mostly excited!
Like I want to strangle you.
Today I going to start my training

It was pretty good. Slept through most of it as people who work third shift do. Tried swimming this evening but the pool was way too cold! Felt like a human popsicle! Thinking of coloring some cats in my coloring book tonight.
Day started out with my son getting angry at me. But things were settled down quickly.  Enjoyed lunch with my sister and her boyfriend then went to their house to help put stereo in cause he couldn't get it working. Then relaxed. We supposed to get storm from the hurricane coming up through georgia. It's been windy all day but actually nice temperature. Now just relaxing.
