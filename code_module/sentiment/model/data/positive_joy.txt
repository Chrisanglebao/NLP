Tired and non motivated
Near tears
Hi. Mixed feelings... I sense change is about to happen at work which I'm unsettled about. Also was thrown a curve ball at the end of the day which I wished I had handled differently. Also feeling unproductive in terms of completion of work deliverables and wishing I could find a way to be more productive

Very random. My moods have fluctuated a lot today.
Today was busy.... It was the end of the first week of school. I have a competition in St. Louis all weekend. I am torn because I know I love competitions when I get there but I always feel so guilty for taking so much time to prepare and leave my girls for a whole weekend. It also costs so much money and it is tight right now. \nWhen I get off of work I have little to no energy for ANYTHING. There is laundry everywhere and little girls nails to be painted. I feel SO overwhelmed everyday like I'm being torn in so many directions and I can't do any of the things well because I don't have the time to devote to them.
so bad. As usual.
im fat and ugly
It was rough but I made it through
